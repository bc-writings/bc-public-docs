\obeyedline  Hello % This is a comment that should not be removed\obeyedline       I want precisely this spacing, and I want to be allowed to use any text, like 1 + (1*2), héhé,\obeyedline  or:\obeyedline \obeyedline  def mycode(my_variable_with_underscore="hey"): # This is a comment (with a single sharp)\obeyedline      print(my_variable_with_underscore)\obeyedline  or latex macros like $\array{a & b\\c & d}$. And ideally unbalanced {} but I heard it was difficult\obeyedline  (maybe by replacing special tokens like \MYCLOSINGBRACE and \MYOPENINGBRACE in the final string?).\obeyedline
