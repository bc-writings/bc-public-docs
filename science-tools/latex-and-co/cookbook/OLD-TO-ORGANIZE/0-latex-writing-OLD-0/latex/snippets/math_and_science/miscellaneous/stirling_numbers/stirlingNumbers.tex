\begin{document}

In mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, a Stirling number of the second kind 
is the number of ways to partition a set of $n$~objects into $k$~non-empty subsets and 
is denoted by~$S(n,k)$ or~$\stirling{a}{b}$. Stirling numbers of the second kind occur 
in the field of mathematics called combinatorics and the study of partitions.
