\section{Label and line number}

\begin{numberIt}
	In the traffic court of a large mid-western city, a young
	lady was brought before the judge to answer a ticket given
	her for driving through a red light. She explained to his
	honor that she was a school teacher and requested an immediate
	\labelIt{disposal} of her case in order that she might hasten
	on to her classes. A wild gleam came into the judge's eye.
	"You are a school teacher, eh?" said he. "Madam, I shall
	realize my lifelong ambition. Sit down at that table and
	write 'I went through a red light' five hundred times."
\end{numberIt}

In the preceding text, wath's the meaning of \emph{disposal} \emph{(see line nb~\ref{disposal})} ?
